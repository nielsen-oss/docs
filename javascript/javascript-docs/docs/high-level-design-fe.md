## Clean Code

### Variables

Give meaningful names to variables

### Functions

1. Function name should describe what it does.
2. A function should do only one thing.
3. Limit the amount of function parameters, preferably two. if you need more you can send the parameters inside an object.
4. If you find yourself writing the same code more than once, even if its a little bit different, try to generalize it in to a function.
5. Functions should be pure

### Classes

### React components

1. Make your React component as short as possible
2. Name Your Components Using Standard Naming Conventions
3. Reduce the number of props to the minimum
4. Put Independent Functions Outside of Your Custom Hooks
5. Split your components to container and presentational components
6. Folderize Your Components

### DRY

DRY is an acronym that stands for "Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself."
If you find yourself writing the same code in different places, consider writing it only once and just reuse it, whether as a function or as a component.

### KISS

KISS is an acronym that stands for "Keep it simple stupid."

### SOLID

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

### Testing

When you write your code, you should write it in a way it would be easy to test it. make your code predictable and testable.

### Error handling

### Comments

If you write clean code, it should be self commenting.

### Type script

## Keep it simple

TBD

## Where should the business logic reside?

Most of our applications use Redux, therefor this section will focus on where to locate logic using redux.
In redux there are actions and reducers. A reducer is a pure function which returns the same value for a specific input and has no side effects.
We also use Selectors ([reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect)) to fetch data from the store.
In a react redux application, the data should be kept on the store.
We prefer putting as much logic in the reducer rather than the selector/action/event handler who started the operation.
Having most of the logic located in the reducer lets us easily test that our flow works as expected since the reducer is a pure function.

## Separation of concerns

Let's start by saying what SoC even means:
"Separation of Concerns (SoC) is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)).  
In React we separate our concerns by using a few tools: Redux, Selectors, React Hooks and React Components (Containers vs Presentational Components).  
1. Redux Manages our data flow and data storage.
2. Selectors help us fetch data from the store and if needed manipulate it for the presentational layer.
3. React Hooks encapsulate a shared logic that can be used wherever needed (`useEventListener`, `useOnClickOutside` etc.).
4. React Components: In here we should distinguish between Containers and Presenetational components.
   1. Containers - Pull out the data from the store and manage all data process.
   2. Presenetational Components - Present the data to the user. They are our **view** layer and should manage the UI and interactions with the user.

Following these rules helps us create building blocks that can be shared and re-used everywhere.

## Compose in Frontend

Composition takes a big place in React's architecture and design.
When building components in React, we usually build them using other components.
Generic base components will help us reuse and extend them to higher components without repeating ourselves.
Lets take a Button component for example:

```jsx
const Button = ({ onClick, className, children }) => {
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick} className={classnames('button', className)}>
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

That's a nice solid base Button.  
What do we do when we need to extend it and also have `PrimaryButton` and `SecondaryButton`?
If we follow the composition pattern, we should do something like this:

```jsx
const PrimaryButton = ({ onClick, className, children }) => {
  return (
    <Button onClick={onClick} className={classnames('primary', className)}>
      I'm a Primary Button
    </Button>
  )
}
```

```jsx
const SecondaryButton = ({ onClick, className, children }) => {
  return (
    <Button onClick={onClick} className={classnames('secondary', className)}>
      I'm a Secondary Button
    </Button>
  )
}
```

A different way to do that is using props to encapsualte that logic within the button.  
That way, we don't really compose the base button but extend it, that's not ideal.

```jsx
const Button = ({ onClick, className, children, variant }) => {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={onClick}
      className={classnames('button', className, {
        primary: variant === 'primary',
        secondary: variant === 'secondary'
      })}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

This approach can make our components too big and handle too much logic, that's why we preffer composing over extending.

## Functional components over Class components

## Get data from store only using selectors

## Top-Down / Undirectional Data Flow

React's data flow is a one-way data flow (AKA one-way binding), we can use either `props` or `state` to pass that data.  
Usually, the data should be gathered in a top component, and it will pass the data to which of it's children who needs it.  
Having said that, "Lifting state up" and "Co-locating state" are two important issues we need to understand.  
"Lifting state up" means that if we have two child components who consume the same state, this state should be kept on their common parent.  
"Co-locating state" means that if we have a child component consuming state that only it needs, it **shouldn't** be kept on the parent component.  
We need to remember that every state change on the parent will cause **all** of it's children to re-render (unless they bail out of the render process), that's why we should
