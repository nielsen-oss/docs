### Clean code

#### Variables
Give meaningful names to variables

#### Functions
1. Function name should describe what it does.
2. A function should do only one thing.
3. Limit the amount of function parameters, preferably two. if you need more you can send the parameters inside an object.
4. If you find yourself writing the same code more than once, even if its a little bit different, try to generalize it in to a function.
5. Functions should be pure

#### Classes

#### React components
1. Make your React component as short as possible
2. Name Your Components Using Standard Naming Conventions
3. Reduce the number of props to the minimum
4. Put Independent Functions Outside of Your Custom Hooks
5. Split your components to container and presentational components
6. Folderize Your Components

#### DRY
DRY is an acronym that stands for "Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself."
If you find yourself writing the same code in different places, consider writing it only once and just reuse it, whether as a function or as a component.

#### KISS
KISS is an acronym that stands for "Keep it simple stupid."

#### SOLID
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)


#### Testing
When you write your code, you should write it in a way it would be easy to test it. make your code predictable and testable.

#### Error handling

#### Comments
If you write clean code, it should be self commenting.

#### Type script
